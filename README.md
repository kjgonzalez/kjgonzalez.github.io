# Intro
Hello and welcome. My name is Kristian Gonzalez, and I have great enthusiasm to learn and improve myself while also improving the world around me. I mainly focus on using neural networks and other machine learning techniques for use with autonomous driving, and I previously worked as an aerospace engineer in the US and in the software team of my Hochschule's driverless Formula Student team. In my free time I practice my skills by implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch, review the programming skills I know, and work to develop new ones based on the kind of work I like to do.
